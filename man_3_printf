.SH NAME
_printf \- Format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fB_printf\fR allows you to output according to the format. The \fBprintf\fR function writes the output to \fIstdout\fR, the standard output stream. This \fBprintf\fR function uses a \fIva_list\fR to display a variadic number of arguments.
.SS Returned value
In case of success, this function returns the number of printed characters (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). In case of an output error, a negative value is returned.
.SS Format string
The conversion format is indicated by a string of characters, starting and finishing in its initial gap state. The format string is composed of ordinary characters (different from %), which are copied without modification to the output, and conversion specifications, which correspond to the following arguments. Conversion specifications are introduced by the character % and end with a conversion indicator (specifier).
.SS Conversion indicator
A character indicates the conversion type to perform. The indicators and their meanings are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBd, i\fR
The argument \fIint\fR is converted to a signed decimal number.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBc\fR
The argument \fIinteger\fR, of type \fIint\fR, is converted to an unsigned char, and the corresponding character is displayed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBs\fR
The argument of type \fIconst char *\fR is a pointer to a string. Characters are written until the null byte ('\0'), excluded.
.IP \[bu] 2
\fB%\fR
A "%" character is written. There is no conversion. The complete indicator is "%%".
.SH EXAMPLES
.EX
To display a simple sentence:
.B
#include "main.h"
.B
_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
.PP
To display a character:
.B
_printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
.PP
To display a string:
.B
_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
.PP
To display a decimal number:
.B
_printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", 39, 39);
